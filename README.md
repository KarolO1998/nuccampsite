#### How to initialize the application

- `npm start`

# Tasks
## Task 1

- [X] Create a new file in your bootstrap course folder and name it aboutus.html (copy and paste the starter content).

- [X] In the head element, add a link to the bootsrtap.min.css, the Lobster font from google, and the styles.css file. At the bottom of the body element, add links to the jquery, popper, and bootstrap JS files.

## Task 2

- Add formatting to the web page using the Bootstrap grid's container, row, and column classes.
- Make sure that:
- [X] The “About Us” title and the "Community Partners" section both stretch across the entire width of their row.
- [X] The “Our Mission” part occupies only half the width of the row for small to extra large screens. 
- [X] The "Our Mission" and "Community Partners" content are each inside two divs. For each, the outer div should have both the row and row-content classes applied.

## Task 3
- [X] In aboutus.html, apply the d-none and d-sm-block Bootstrap responsive classes to the p elements containing the descriptions of the community partners so that they are hidden on only extra small screens.
- Read the documentation on these classes. See how the combination of classes shown here enables you to hide the content for XS screen sizes. 
- [X] Also apply these two classes to the three p elements in the body of index.html.
- [x] In index.html's footer, in the Links, also update the link to About to point to "aboutus.html" instead of "#". 
- [x] Afterward, in a XS viewport, the Community Partners section of your aboutus.html page should look like this: see assignment page
